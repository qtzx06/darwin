# API Connection Status 🔌

## ✅ **FULLY CONNECTED APIs**

### 1. **Core Battle Workflow** (competitiveApi)
- ✅ `orchestrateProject()` - Breaks down project into subtasks
- ✅ `startWork()` - Starts agents working on a subtask
- ✅ `getResults()` - Gets all agent results after work
- ✅ `selectWinner()` - User selects round winner
- ✅ `completeRound()` - Completes round and stores winner code
- ✅ `retrieveCode()` - Fetches agent code for display
- ✅ `getProjectStatus()` - Gets final project status
- ✅ `getCommentary()` - Gets Letta AI commentary for subtask

**Status:** 🟢 All core workflow APIs connected and working!

### 2. **LiveKit Voice System** (livekitApi)
- ✅ `createBattleRoom()` - Creates LiveKit room for battle
- ✅ `askCommentator()` - Gets AI commentary and triggers TTS
- ✅ `getAgentReaction()` - Gets agent reactions to battle events
- ✅ `speakText()` - Converts text to speech (used internally)

## ⚠️ **PARTIALLY CONNECTED APIs**

### 3. **Agent Chat System** (agentChatApi)
**Available but NOT yet integrated:**
- ⚠️ `directChat()` - One agent talks to another
- ⚠️ `groupChat()` - Multiple agents discuss a topic
- ⚠️ `battleTalk()` - Agents trash talk during battle

**Current Usage:** Agent reactions are used, but full chat system is dormant.

**Potential Integration:**
```javascript
// Could add during battle rounds:
const chatMessages = await agentChatApi.battleTalk(
  projectId, 
  { current_leader: winner, round_number: round },
  'round_complete'
);
// Display in ChatInput component
```

## 🚫 **NOT YET CONNECTED APIs**

### 4. **Additional LiveKit Features**
- 🔴 `joinRoom()` - Frontend joining LiveKit room (removed in simplification)
- 🔴 `getRoomStatus()` - Get room participant count
- 🔴 `getTranscript()` - Get full battle transcript
- 🔴 `setMode()` - Switch between commentary/agent mode
- 🔴 `askAgent()` - Ask individual agents questions

**Note:** These were part of the WebRTC approach we simplified away.

### 5. **Additional Core APIs**

- 🔴 `createAgents()` - Separate agent creation (handled by orchestrate)
- 🔴 `getAgentStats()` - Get win/loss stats per agent

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### High Priority (Would be awesome for Cal Hacks demo):

1. **Agent Chat During Battle** 🔥
   ```javascript
   // Add to runCompetitiveWorkflow after each round
   const battleChat = await agentChatApi.battleTalk(
     projectId,
     { winner: selectedWinner, round: currentRound },
     'round_complete'
   );
   setChatMessages(prev => [...prev, ...battleChat.messages]);
   ```
   **Why:** Shows personality, makes it entertaining!

2. **Agent Stats Display** 📊
   ```javascript
   // Add to UI somewhere
   const stats = await competitiveApi.getAgentStats(projectId);
   // Show win rates, code quality, speed metrics
   ```
   **Why:** Data visualization, competitive element!

3. **Live Transcript Panel** 📝
   ```javascript
   // Already have TranscriptPanel component!
   const transcript = await livekitApi.getTranscript(roomName);
   // Show full battle commentary history
   ```
   **Why:** Users can review what commentator said!

### Medium Priority (Nice to have):

4. **Progress Messages** ⏳
   - Show what each agent is thinking/doing in real-time
   - Update AgentCard with live status

5. **Health Check** 🏥
   - Add backend connection indicator
   - Show if Letta/LiveKit are available

### Low Priority (Polish):

6. **Room Status** 👥
   - Show if other spectators are watching
   - Display participant count

## 🎮 **Quick Wins for Demo**

If you have time before Cal Hacks, add:

1. **Battle Chat** (15 min) - Agents trash talk each other
2. **Stats Display** (20 min) - Show agent win rates
3. **Transcript Panel** (10 min) - Already have component, just wire it up

These would make your demo 10x more engaging! 🔥
