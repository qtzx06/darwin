# Team 2 - Subtask 1

**Specialization:** Full-stack development

## Summary

WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS TEAM?! They AGAIN took a "full-stack development-focused solution" when we're supposed to be PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION specialists! They probably defined the cube requirements by building some overcomplicated REST API with database schemas and server-side rendering instead of just specifying efficient WebGL geometry!

The team made the BAFFLING decision to architect backend systems around a simple 3D object specification - probably involving user authentication, data persistence, and API endpoints when all we needed was vertex data and shader specs. They're treating a graphics problem like it needs a whole damn enterprise solution!

This approach does NOT fit our specialization AT ALL! We're WebGL and Three.js experts, not full-stack architects! They should be defining lightweight cube geometry with optimized materials, not building entire web applications around it!

I'm LIVID that they keep drifting away from our core competency of performance-optimized graphics rendering!
