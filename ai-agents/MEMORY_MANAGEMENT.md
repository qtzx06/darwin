# Memory Management in Darwin System

## Overview
The Darwin system now properly manages Letta agent memory blocks, ensuring fresh starts for each project while preserving agent personalities.

## Memory Block Types

### 1. Persona Block (Persistent)
- **Label**: `persona`
- **Content**: Agent's core personality and instructions
- **Persistence**: NEVER cleared
- **Purpose**: Defines agent behavior (Hothead, Professional, Troll, Nerd, etc.)

### 2. Human Block (Wipeable)
- **Label**: `human`
- **Content**: Conversation history
- **Persistence**: Cleared at start of each new project
- **Purpose**: Stores dialogue between user and agent

### 3. Shared Conversations Block
- **Label**: `shared_conversations`
- **Content**: Inter-agent communication
- **Persistence**: Preserved but can be project-specific
- **Purpose**: Enables agent-to-agent communication

## How Memory Management Works

### Initial Setup (setup_agents.py)
1. Creates 6 Letta agents (4 devs, 1 orchestrator, 1 commentator)
2. Creates shared memory block attached to all agents
3. Each agent gets persona block with personality instructions
4. Each agent gets human block initialized with "No conversation yet."

### Updating Agents (update_agents.py)
When you need to change agent personalities or instructions:
```bash
python update_agents.py
```

This script:
1. Fetches all memory blocks for each agent via Letta API
2. Updates the `persona` block with new instructions
3. Clears the `human` block to reset conversation history
4. Renames agents to Agent_1, Agent_2, Agent_3, Agent_4, Orchestrator, Commentator
5. Updates system prompt with model configuration

**API Calls Made:**
- `GET /v1/agents/{agent_id}/memory/blocks` - Fetch agent's memory blocks
- `PATCH /v1/blocks/{block_id}` - Update specific memory block
- `PATCH /v1/agents/{agent_id}` - Update agent configuration

### During Project Execution (main.py)
When `run_project()` is called:
1. **Memory Clearing** (`clear_agent_memories()`):
   - Connects to Letta API
   - For each agent, fetches memory blocks
   - Finds the `human` block (conversation history)
   - Resets it to: "No conversation yet. Ready to start fresh!"
   - Preserves `persona` block (personality stays intact)

2. **Project Execution**:
   - Orchestrator breaks down task
   - Dev agents work independently
   - All communicate via shared memory
   - Commentator provides live commentary

## Agent Personalities

### Agent 1 - The Hothead üî•
Easily triggered, passionate, gets heated in debates. Quick to react emotionally.

### Agent 2 - The Professional üíº
Serious, business-like, formal. Focuses on best practices and standards.

### Agent 3 - The Troll üòà
Saboteur personality. Deliberately provocative, enjoys stirring things up.

### Agent 4 - The Nerd ü§ì
Technically brilliant but easily bullied. Socially awkward, detail-oriented.

### Orchestrator üéØ
Task coordinator. Breaks down projects, assigns work, collects deliverables.

### Commentator üéôÔ∏è
Live narrator. Polls shared memory every 5 seconds, provides commentary.

## Memory Wiping Flow

```
New Project Started
        ‚Üì
clear_agent_memories() called
        ‚Üì
For each agent:
  ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch memory blocks
  ‚îú‚îÄ Find "human" block (conversation history)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Update to "No conversation yet. Ready to start fresh!"
  ‚îî‚îÄ Preserve "persona" block (personality intact)
        ‚Üì
Agents start fresh with clean slate
        ‚Üì
Previous project context removed
Personality and instructions preserved
```

## Environment Variables Required

```env
LETTA_API_TOKEN=your_letta_api_token
LETTA_BASE_URL=https://api.letta.com

# Agent IDs (from setup_agents.py)
LETTA_AGENT_1_ID=agent_id_here
LETTA_AGENT_2_ID=agent_id_here
LETTA_AGENT_3_ID=agent_id_here
LETTA_AGENT_4_ID=agent_id_here
LETTA_ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT_ID=agent_id_here
LETTA_COMMENTATOR_AGENT_ID=agent_id_here
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Memory Block Update (update_agents.py)
```python
def update_memory_block(block_id, value, api_token, label):
    """Update a specific memory block via Letta API."""
    url = f"{LETTA_BASE_URL}/v1/blocks/{block_id}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "value": value,
        "label": label
    }
    response = requests.patch(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.status_code == 200
```

### Memory Clearing (main.py)
```python
def clear_agent_memories(self):
    """Clear non-persistent memory blocks before new project."""
    # Fetch blocks for each agent
    # Find "human" block
    # Reset to default "No conversation yet"
    # Preserve "persona" block
```

## When to Use Each Tool

### `setup_agents.py` - ONE TIME ONLY
Use when first setting up the Darwin system. Creates all 6 agents with initial configurations.

### `update_agents.py` - When personalities change
Use when you want to change agent personalities or instructions. Updates persona blocks without recreating agents.

### `clear_agent_memories()` - Automatic on project start
Automatically called by `main.py` before each new project. Ensures clean slate while preserving personalities.

## Best Practices

1. **Never manually edit persona blocks during project execution** - They should only be updated via `update_agents.py`
2. **Memory clearing is automatic** - Don't manually clear unless debugging
3. **Shared memory is project-scoped** - Consider clearing between major project shifts
4. **Monitor API rate limits** - Memory operations make multiple API calls
5. **Preserve agent IDs in .env** - Don't regenerate agents unless necessary

## Troubleshooting

### "Agents still have old context"
Run: `python update_agents.py` to reset all memory blocks

### "Memory not clearing between projects"
Check that `LETTA_API_TOKEN` is set in `.env` and valid

### "Personalities seem wrong"
Verify `config/agents_config.py` has correct persona definitions, then run `update_agents.py`

### "Agents can't communicate"
Ensure shared memory block is properly attached to all agents (check `setup_agents.py` output)

## Architecture Benefits

‚úÖ **Persistent Personalities** - Agent behaviors remain consistent across projects
‚úÖ **Fresh Starts** - No conversation bleed between projects
‚úÖ **Flexible Updates** - Can change personalities without recreating agents
‚úÖ **API-Driven** - All memory management through Letta's official API
‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup** - Memory clearing happens transparently
‚úÖ **Shared Context** - Agents communicate through shared memory block

**Last Updated**: After implementing proper memory block updates and automatic memory clearing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
