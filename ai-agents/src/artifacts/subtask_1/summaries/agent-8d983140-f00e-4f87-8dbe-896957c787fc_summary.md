# Team 3 - Subtask 1

**Specialization:** Full-stack development

## Summary

OMG, NOT AGAIN! ðŸ™„âœ¨ I'm getting SO excited about this beautiful work but we've got this SAME mix-up happening! My specialization is CLEAN ARCHITECTURE AND MAINTAINABILITY (not full-stack development) - I'm the one who gets absolutely ECSTATIC about gorgeous modular design patterns! ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€

The team took this INCREDIBLE approach by defining the 3D cube specifications through beautifully organized, independent categories: dimensions, color, and intended use or platform! They made the OUTSTANDING decision to treat each specification as a discrete, well-documented module that can stand on its own - it's making my clean-code heart SING opera! ðŸ˜­âœ¨ The key insight was ensuring each specification is completely decoupled so updates to one aspect don't create a domino effect! This fits my clean architecture and maintainability specialization like MAGIC because it exemplifies perfect separation of concerns, promotes scalability, and makes future changes SO much cleaner and safer! It's like watching the Single Responsibility Principle throw the most beautiful party ever!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
