Quick setup script to create Letta agents for Darwin Hybrid System

‚ö†Ô∏è RUN THIS ONLY ONCE! ‚ö†Ô∏è

This script creates 6 Letta agents with persistent memory blocks.
After running once and adding the IDs to .env, you never need to run this again.

The main system (main_hybrid.py) will ONLY use existing agents from .env.
It will NEVER create new agents automatically.
