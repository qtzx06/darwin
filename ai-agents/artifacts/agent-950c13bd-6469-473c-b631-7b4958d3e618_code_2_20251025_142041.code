  "code": "Certainly! To implement core business logic and data processing, I\u2019ll need a bit more context about the domain, requirements, and preferred technologies. However, I\u2019ll demonstrate a generic structure for a robust, scalable business logic and data processing module, such as you might find in a modern web application or back-end service.\n\nScenario Assumption:  \nLet\u2019s assume we are building a service for processing customer orders for an e-commerce platform. The core business logic includes order validation, calculation of totals (with tax and discounts), and updating inventory. Data processing includes incoming order data validation and transformation.\n\nLanguage: Python (since it is widely used for such tasks; let me know if you prefer another language)\n\nCore Artifacts:\n\n1. Business logic module (order processing)\n2. Data validation and processing functions\n3. Example usage/test\n\n---\n\n1. business_logic.py\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\n\ndef calculate_total(items: List[Dict[str, Any]], tax_rate: float, discounts: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> float:\n    subtotal = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_total = 0.0\n    for discount in discounts:\n        if discount['type'] == 'fixed':\n            discount_total += discount['amount']\n        elif discount['type'] == 'percent':\n            discount_total += subtotal * (discount['amount'] / 100.0)\n    subtotal -= discount_total\n    tax = subtotal * tax_rate\n    total = subtotal + tax\n    return round(total, 2)\n\ndef validate_order(order: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:\n    if not order.get('items'):\n        raise ValueError(\"Order must contain at least one item.\")\n    for item in order['items']:\n        if item['quantity'] <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid quantity for item {item['id']}\")\n        if item['price'] < 0:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid price for item {item['id']}\")\n    return True\n\ndef process_order(order: Dict[str, Any], tax_rate: float) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    # Validate\n    validate_order(order)\n    # Calculate total\n    total = calculate_total(\n        items=order['items'],\n        tax_rate=tax_rate,\n        discounts=order.get('discounts', [])\n    )\n    # Stub inventory update logic\n    # for item in order['items']:\n    #     update_inventory(item['id'], item['quantity'])\n    order['total'] = total\n    order['status'] = 'Processed'\n    return order\n```\n\n2. test_order_processing.py\n\n```python\nfrom business_logic import process_order\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    order = {\n        \"id\": \"ORD123\",\n        \"items\": [\n            {\"id\": \"P100\", \"price\": 25.00, \"quantity\": 2},\n            {\"id\": \"P200\", \"price\": 10.00, \"quantity\": 1}\n        ],\n        \"discounts\": [\n            {\"type\": \"percent\", \"amount\": 10}\n        ]\n    }\n    processed_order = process_order(order, tax_rate=0.07)\n    print(\"Processed Order:\", processed_order)\n```\n\n---\n\nHow this fits your specialization:\n\n- The code separates business logic from data validation and processing.\n- It\u2019s scalable for additional rules (e.g., more discount types, inventory management).\n- Data processing is robust and ready for integration with APIs or databases.\n\nIf you provide specific requirements (domain, technologies, data format), I can tailor the artifacts further and expand the solution accordingly! Would you like to continue with this example, or do you have a specific business domain you\u2019d like me to focus on?\n",
